Benchmark on JADE Message Transport package.

INTRODUCTION
This package contains a Java implementation of test to show 
how works JADE Message Transport and to show JADE behaviours
when agents' number is high. 
You can run these tests for two configurations:
1) Intra platform communication:
	a) all agents are in Main-Container;
	b) receiver agents in Main-Container and sender agents
	   in onother Container;
2) Inter platform communication:
	a) MTP IIOP;
	b) MTP ORBacus;
	c) MTP HTTP.

SOFTWARE VERSIONS
This version of the package was tested using the following software:
  - JDK 1.3.0 and higher
  - JADE 2.5

COMPILING
If you have "ANT" program on your computer, in benchmark find build.xml
so digit: ant
Notice that kind of Makefile works with every OS.

PACKAGE CONTENTS
Enclosed in this package is the source code, some typical configuration files,
and some documentation. A tutorial is also available with all the JADE tutorials.
After compilation you'll find also classess and doc directories. 


GETTING STARTED
- compile the benchmark java source files
- set the CLASSPATH to include jade.jar and benchmark/classes
- if you want to benchmark the inter-platform communication then the
  CLASSPATH must also include the implementation of the MTP (e.g. iiop.jar,
  httpMTP.jar, ORBacusMTP.jar)
- all tests can be executed by passing a configuration file to the JADE platform,
  as follows:
  java jade.Boot -conf file.conf
- in the conf directory a set of typical configuration files have been provided:
  - receiverSernderMainCont.conf 
	for intra-platform intra-container communication
  - receiver.conf and sender2Containers.conf 
	for intra-platform inter-container communication
  - receiver.conf and senderIIOP.conf
	for inter-platform communication based on JDK1.4 IIOP implementation
  - receiverOrbacus.conf and senderOrbacus.conf
	for inter-platform communication based on ORBacus IIOP implementation
  - receiverHttp.conf and senderHttp.conf
	for inter-platform communication based on ORBacus IIOP implementation
  REMIND TO:
  - launch before the container/platform with the receivers agents, and after
    the container/platform with the sender agents
  - edit the configuration files and set the proper values:
    - host is the hostname of the JADE platform with the receivers
    - hap is the hap of the JADE platform with the receivers
    - IOR is the IOR of the JADE platform with the receivers
    - iterations is the number of times the message exchange will be
      executed for each couple of agents
    - couples is the number of couples of agents
    - agents is the list of agents to be launched



PARALLEL TEST
In the previous tests each sender sends a message and wait for a reply before sending 
the next one, in a "serial" fashion.
For the group of tests "parallel", a sender sends in sequence all the messages without 
waiting for the replies.
Some configuration files for the parallel tests are available:
    - ParalleTestSingleContainer.conf
	for intra-container measurements
    - ParalleTest2Containers_TX.conf, ParalleTest2Containers_RX.conf
	for inter-container measurements
